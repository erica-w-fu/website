developed at the Connected Experience HCI Lab at CMU. Using social influence principles, this app aims to effectively teach and encourage cybersecurity habits to young adults. As the head developer on the team, I collaborate with designers and other researchers to develop an application that will be first used to test our research questions and eventually be deployed to the app store for public use. Additionally, I help with talk alouds and intermediate user studies to gain insights and early feedback.\t\n  twentyfour\t24\tSwiftXCode\tJune 2019 - January 2021\t24 was a personal project I developed to learn XCode basics. I was inspired by my brother's love for the card game, 24, and hoped to make something an app so he could play even without a deck of cards. I first created the app in 2019, but then created a second iteration with a simpler, more effective design in 2021. In the future, I would like to add multiplayer capabilities to incorporate the competitiveness of the card game.\t\n  sentence_mosaics\tSentence Mosaics\tReact JavascriptCSSHTML\tAugust 2020 - May 2021\tSentence mosaics is a language therapy app that assists individuals with the formation of novel, complete, and meaningful sentences with a digital language coach.
